[How to do research](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fWNPS5Ts2s13T3GFQIo_6H2LEOT1ZVHy-Pu_tDHHp_A/edit#slide=id.p) is a slide that contains my experience about how to do research (including reading, writing and presenting papers). A large number of students, both native and international, find it to be practical! I hope it would help your career as well.

Please enjoy the materials and feedbacks are always welcome!
