This slides originate from Hang Liu when he was a PhD student. He actively maintains and updates this slides through his own experience. Now, a considerable number of students, both native and international, find the slides to be constructive! 

After a discussion with Dr. Chunhua Liao at ACM FCRC '19, Hang Liu decided to *open source* the slides, hoping them would benefit the public at large.
